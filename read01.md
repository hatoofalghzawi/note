I think I found what might suit me in text editing, as I always prefer comprehensive matters as well as in editors, so I chose IDE because it is simply a comprehensive, integrated group that facilitates our work, saves time and effort. Software development requires extensive knowledge of grammar, symbols, formats, and good knowledge of the language  Therefore, IDE is a very suitable option


 it is suitable for a developer who has a good background in programming so I will use it in the future, but today I think but I need to use brackets as it provides everything for beginners.  It includes all the features available in others and works on all types of devices.




As for the programming world, the options are very wide and the programs are numerous in line with the various directives of the developers, so we find programs that come with the devices themselves, but they are not very feasible as they will not modify your errors, translate or even complete your codes, and as for the development programs, there are many of them with programming basics and free or paid additions  Symbolically, including and what is comprehensive and free, purely and some of them are limited in two or three languages. You have the freedom to choose what you like and love.
